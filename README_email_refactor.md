# Email Module Refactoring

## Overview
The email functionality has been refactored to eliminate code duplication between the command-line and GUI versions of the media manager.

## Changes Made

### New Shared Module
- **`email_utils.py`** - Centralized email functionality for both CLI and GUI applications

### Updated Files
- **`generate_missing_media_list.py`** - Now uses shared email module
- **`media_manager_gui.py`** - Now uses shared email module  
- **`email_debug_test.py`** - Updated to use new EmailConfig class

## Benefits

### ✅ Eliminated Code Duplication
- Single source of truth for email functionality
- Fixes only need to be applied in one place
- Consistent behavior across CLI and GUI

### ✅ Better Configuration Management
- Unified EmailConfig class
- Support for both hardcoded (CLI) and config file (GUI) approaches
- Validation of email configuration

### ✅ Improved Maintainability
- Cleaner, more modular code
- Easier to add new email features
- Better error handling and logging

## Usage

### Command Line Script
The CLI script automatically uses hardcoded email settings that can be edited in `email_utils.py`:

```python
# Users update these values in email_utils.py
def create_email_config_hardcoded():
    return EmailConfig(
        sender_name="YOUR_NAME_HERE",
        sender_email="YOUR_EMAIL_HERE",
        receiver_email="RECEIVER_EMAIL_HERE",
        password="PASSWORD_HERE",
        smtp_server="smtp.server.com",
        smtp_port=587
    )
```

### GUI Application
The GUI continues to use `media_manager_config.json` for configuration through the interface.

### Debug Script
The debug script now uses the shared module and EmailConfig class for consistency.

## Backward Compatibility
- GUI configuration files remain unchanged
- Command-line usage remains the same
- All existing functionality preserved

## Future Improvements
- Could standardize both CLI and GUI to use config files
- Could add support for additional email providers
- Could add email templating capabilities
